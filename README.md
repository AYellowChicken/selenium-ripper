# Web Data Extraction and Conversion

## Overview

This Python project comprises two scripts, `bmpfirefox.py` and `har_rip.py`, designed to automate web data extraction and conversion tasks. These scripts enable you to create a proxy server, navigate web pages, and download and convert files. Below are the key functionalities of each script:

### `bmpfirefox.py`

1. **Proxy Server Creation**: The `bmpfirefox.py` script creates a proxy server using Browsermobproxy. This server is essential for monitoring and intercepting web traffic.

2. **Selenium Browser Automation**: It instantiates a Selenium Firefox Browser and connects to a given URL through the Browsermobproxy server. This setup allows you to automate actions on the browser, such as navigating to web pages and interacting with elements.

3. **Data Capture**: The script captures all the information from the web session and saves it as a .har (HTTP Archive) file. This file contains data about network requests and responses, which can be used for analysis and processing.

### `har_rip.py`

1. **Har File Parsing**: The `har_rip.py` script parses the .har file generated by `bmpfirefox.py`. This file contains data about web traffic during the session.

2. **File Download**: It is responsible for downloading specific files from the web page as specified in the .har file.

3. **File Conversion**: The script converts webp files to jpg format. This conversion is useful for standardizing the file format for further use or display.

4. **File Storage**: The downloaded and converted files are stored on the server for future reference or analysis.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Run `bmpfirefox.py`**: Execute the first script to set up the proxy server, initiate the Selenium browser, perform web actions, and save the .har file.

2. **Run `har_rip.py`**: Execute the second script to parse the .har file, download and convert specific files, and store them on the server.

3. **Customization**: Customize the scripts to meet your specific web data extraction and conversion requirements. You can modify the URL, automate actions, specify the files to download, or adjust the conversion settings.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following libraries and tools:

- Selenium: Used for browser automation.
- Browsermobproxy: Used for creating the proxy server.
